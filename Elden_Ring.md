# Levelling strategy

1. After the initial levelling up so we can use Moonveil, the next priority is getting Vigour to 30.
2. Then level Intelligence to 57. With Rennala's hat that takes us to the 60 we need for Comet Azur.
3. Level Vigour to 40.
4. Rest of the points go in to Mind.

# General Boss Strategy

The general strategy in most boss fights now is spam Transient Moonlight (heavy attack version) until they are dead, using Mimic Tear once we've got it. There are a few exceptions:

- Borealis the Freezing Fog: Rock Sling aimed at the head until stagger, then riposte with Moonveil.
- Not really a boss but the Draconic Tree Sentinel before Maliketh: Terra Magica, infinite FP and Comet Azur.
- Gideon Ofnir the All Knowing: Terra Magica, infinite FP and Comet Azur.
- Radagon of the Golden Order: Use Greatshield Soldier ashes to pin them down then Terra Magica, infinite FP and Comet Azur. Elden Beast is back to Transient Moonlight spam.
