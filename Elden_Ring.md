# Elden Ring Brisk Jog

Not a speedrun, but a glitch free kinda fast but still possible for normal people route.

Needs a bit more fleshing out, just jotting down some ideas and important points for now.

# Starting the run

- Start a new game as a Samurai.
- Go to the Gatefront Ruins site of grace, rest and get Torrent
- Get the map fragment and stone that lets you change the ash of war you use
- Rescue Boc and talk until you get mushrooms
- Grab the Gold Fowl Foot and Somber Smithing Stone [1]
- Get to Third Church of Marika, get the Flask of Wonderous Physik and Sacred Tear
- Teleport to Caelid, kill the sleeping dragon, pop the Gold Fowl Foot before the final blow
- Level up Dex to 18, Int to 23
- Go to Church of Ellah, get the spirit bell from Ranni, and buy the crafting kit and 3 cracked pots
- Get to Stormhill shack, talk to Roderika
- Get Golden Vow and another SST[1]
- Get to the merchant after Saintsbridge and buy another cracked pot, keep going to grab Trina's Lily x 3 and a mushroom, and get the Fervor's Cookbook
