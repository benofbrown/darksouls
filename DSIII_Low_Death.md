# Dark Souls III - Low Death run

This is my current strategy for finishing the game with as few deaths as possible. On the 22nd October 2016 I managed a run with 0 deaths. Since then there have been several patches to the game which have reduced the viability of my strategy, so I have switched to a new one. The previous strategy can be seen in the release 'pre-1.12'.

The general strategy is to use the *Sellsword Twinblades*, levelling up Vigour and Dexterity.

## Character Creation

- Start as *Mercenary*.
- Choose the *Black Firebombs*.

## Phase I - Preparation

This phase takes around 45 minutes, and can be a little scary at times. If you die in this phase you need to reset the run which can be frustrating, particularly near the end. If you survive it though you'll have a +4 weapon and a lot of HP so the next few stages should be easy.

- Grab the soul item off to the right near the start.
- Grab the *Ashen estus flask*.
- Make the jump over by the tree and grab the *Titanite Shard*.
- Drop down, killing the crossbow guy and get the *Firebombs*.
- Kill all the mobs around there.
- Kill Iudex Gundyr. You can hit him with four L1 hits as he wakes up. After that you want to parry/riposte him twice. If you hit him between parries he'll hit the second phase so you'll only be able to do one parry, so avoid hitting him until you get the second one in. Then stick close to his left leg and hit him a lot.
- Unequip the *Ashen estus flask*, and all the items on your fast-menu whilst waiting for the door to open.
- Kill all the mobs outside *Firelink Shrine*, but leave *Sword Master* well alone.
- Grab the other *Homeward Bone* and *Embers* around the outside of the shrine, and the *East-West Shield*.
- Go in the shrine, run up and out, grab the soul item and do the Tree skip
- Drop the following for the crows:
    - 1 x *Firebomb*
    - 1 x *Black Firebomb*
- This will give you:
    - 1 x *Large Titanite Shard*
    - 1 x *Titanite Chunk*
- Grab the *Estus Shard*.
- Go through the illusory wall and get, then equip the *Silver Serpent Ring*
- Go back down inside the shrine, talk to the *Shrine Handmaiden* and sell all the soul items, the *Embers*, and the *East-West Shield*.
- Talk to *Andre* and allot all your estus to be healing, and upgrade the Estus Flask.
- Talk to the *Firekeeper* and level up *Vigour* as much as you can.
- Embed the coil and warp to the *High Wall of Lothric*

### High Wall of Lothric

- Light the bonfire, and run down the stairs, taking the slightly raised path on the left. Grab the soul item there.
- Keep running, then go up the stairs on the left, loop around the dead dragon and drop down by a small tower. Grab the *Gold Pine Resin*.
- Drop down the hole, landing on the platform on the way down to avoid fall damage. Head out the door then run up the stairs past the mobs, and straight ahead through the door.
- Jump over to the other side, go through the door, stay on the raised path on the left and kill the mob there.
- Grab the soul item, then dodge the Lothric Knight and run up to, and then past, the *Tower on the Wall* bonfire.
- Grab the *Titanite Shard* there and go back to the bonfire, light it and rest at it if necessary.
- Go back downstairs, grab the *Firebombs* on the beam and drop down to the lower level. I like to plunge attack the mob here. Head outside, grab the soul item and kill the mobs who climb over the walls.
- Grab the *Firebombs* on the roof, and the soul item there.
- Drop down to the next level, and go in to the building there and take the first left.
- Kill the arbalist at the top of the stairs, then turn around and kill the lantern wielder behind you. Move in to the next room killing the bandit on the left and grab the *Titanite Shard*. Go back down the stairs, smash the pots and kill the mob behind them, and grab the *Undead Hunter Charm*.
- Dodge past the Lothric Knight with the spear, and sprint in to the corridor. A mob will follow you, turn around and kill it.
- Carefully clear out this room. Start from the top and get rid of the thief and the firebomb guy. Pick up the *Silver Kite Shield*.
- Go down the stairs and aggro, then kill the dog. Next go for the greataxe guy to the right near the balcony, then the Halbard mob, followed by the other greataxe mob then finally the dog near the *Cell Key*. Grab the *Cell Key*, *Estus Shard* and *Titianite Shard* before using a *Homeward Bone* to go back to the bonfire.
- Drop down through the hole in the floor, kill the halberd mob, go down the stairs and kill the two mobs there. Rescue *Greirat* and equip the *Blue Tearstone Ring*.
- Backtrack to the building where the Pus of Man erupts and drop down. Grab the *Black Firebombs* before carefully dropping down to the courtyard, grabbing the *Embers* and running out of the gate.
- Kill the crossbowman on the right, turn around and kill the other mob. Grab the soul item there and make your way to the Cathedral, talking to *Emma* and getting the *Small Lothric Banner*.
- Run back the way you came, then down the stairs to kill *Vordt of the Boreal Valley* using a *Gold Pine Resin* buff. Should be easy.
- Fly to the *Foot of the Wall*.

### Undead Settlement

- Grab the soul item right near the start, to the left.
- Get the *Alluring Skulls*, *Homeward Bones* and talk to *Yoel of Londor* until he disappears.
- Get *Loretta's Bone*, then grab the *Estus Shard* behind the evangelist, run to the left and grab the *Titanite Shard*. Now run by the cliff edge and go over the bridge.
- Grab the soul item in the stables after killing the mobs. Kill the thief that drops down (should take three hits) and open the door.
- Bait the firebomb throwers in to blowing up the barrels, then drop down. Rest at the *Cliff Underside* bonfire, backtrack and kill the mobs down there before grabbing the *Titanite Shard* by the last one of them. Warp back to *Firelink Shrine*.
- Talk to the handmaiden, and sell all the soul items, *Embers* and weapons/shields you're not using. Buy a *Dagger* and a *Torch*.
- Talk to Andre, upgrade the *Sellsword Twinblades* to +2. Give him both *Estus Shards* you have.
- Talk to Greirat, and give him *Loretta's Bone*.
- Talk to the Firekeeper, and level Vigour more.
- Warp back to *Cliff Underside*.
- **[Potential Danger]** Go around towards the small bridge, and wait for the mobs to disperse. Run across it, and dodge the pot throwers. Keep running until you bump in to *Siegward of Catarina*. **Make sure you talk to Siegward!**
- Send the lift down, then take it up and make friends with the giant and grabbing the soul item up there, before going back down, then sending it up, and taking it down to the bottom.
- Run past the Outrider Knight, open the door and rest at the *Road of Sacrifices* bonfire.

### Road of Sacrifices

- Run through, killing the Corvians, and grabbing the *Titanite Shard* towards the end.
- Run down to the *Halfway Fortress* bonfire.
- Kill the first two mobs with the tree stumps and drop down to the left to find another *Titanite Shard*. Drop down again near here for yet another *Titanite Shard*.
- Go around the left hand edge of the area, carefully killing the four mobs. Drop down for an *Estus Shard*.
- **[Potential Danger]** Kill the crucified mob and head to the *Crucifixion Woods* bonfire, grabbing the *Ember* and soul item on the way.
- Go to the edge of the water, drop down when it's low and run to the other side, grabbing the *Fallen Knight* set. Grab the soul item nearby.
- **[Potential Danger]** Carefully run past the gank squad, down the ladder and light the *Farron Keep* bonfire.

### Farron Keep

- Go out and slightly to the right. Use the *Dagger*'s quickstep and head to the base of the slope you can see. Run up the steps and extinguish the flame. Pick up the *Homeward Bone* here and backtrack to the bonfire.
- Go out and to the left slightly, don't sprint until near the swamp edge to minimise poison risk.
- Grab the *Estus Shard*, and just after it a *Titanite Shard*.
- Go up the hill carefully, there are two ghrus at the top. Kill them and extinguish the flame.
- Walk around the jumping ghru. Grab the *Titanite Shard* near the wall, but leave the other well alone (it will aggro the ghru).
- Kill the ghru at the top of the stairs, and grab the *Purple Moss Clump* before extinguishing the flame.
- Run to the *Keep Ruins* bonfire and rest.
- Head down the ramp to the domed building on the right, drop off the side of the ramp near the top to grab a *Titanite Shard*.
- Grab the *Undead Bone Shard* near the slugs, then go up the ladder. Go around the side of the building and kill the Crystal Lizard for a *Twinkling Titanite*. Go through the illusory wall to get the *Dreamchaser's Ashes*.
- Take the lift up, but don't fight the Stray Demon. Instead go the other way, drop down and go around the side, killing the two Crystal Lizards there for two *Large Titanite Shards*. Also get the *Dragoncrest Shield*.
- Homeward Bone to *Firelink Shrine*. I used to take the lift back down but the drop from the gate can kill you if you don't get it quite right so it's safter to warp out.
- Talk to *Sirris of the Sunset Realm*.
- Give the *Dreamchaser's Ashes* to the *Shrine Handmaiden* and sell her all your soul items, *Embers*, and unused equipment.
- Go to *Andre* and upgrade your weapon to *Sellsword Twinblades +4*. Also use the two *Estus Shards* to reinforce your estus.
- Go to the *Firekeeper* and level up *Vigour* as much as you can. If it hits 25, then start levelling *Dexterity* instead.
- Burn the *Undead Bone Shard* that you have.
- Warp to *Cliff Underside*.
- Go down to where the rats are and light the *Dilapidated Bridge* bonfire. Also equip the *Bloodbite Ring*.
- Kill *Holy Knight Hodrick*.
- Backtrack to the right of the bonfire (but left of the main path) and kill the crystal lizard there for a *Sharp Gem*.
- Go through the graveyard, pick up the *Mortician's Ashes* and *Undead Bone Shard*.
- Open the short cut door, then kill the *Curse-rotted Greatwood*.
- Warp to *Keep Ruins*, then run to *Farron Keep Perimeter* and light it.
- Keep going past the bonfire, kill the giant Crystal Lizard, open the door and grab the *Sellsword Twinblades*, *Sellsword Set* and *Farron Coal*.
- Use a Homeward Bone to warp back to Firelink.
- Talk to the handmaiden and sell the *Sellsword Twinblade* you just picked up, and the duplicate *Sellsword Set*.
- Talk to Andre, give him the *Farron Coal* and Sharp infuse the *Sellsword Twinblade +4*.
- Talk to *Grierat* to get the *Curl Up* gesture.
- Burn the two *Undead Bone Shards*.
- Go to *Yoel of Londor* and choose the *Draw Out True Strength* option, also levelling up *Dexterity* (you should have 25 Vigour already).

### Point of no return

Once we've got the *Dark Sigil* from *Yoel of Londor* we will gain one Hollowing with each death. As we now have a working death counter, this is the point at which we don't need to reset on death, although a death now would be disappointing.

## Phase II: Easy mode

This phase is pretty easy as you're quite OP by this point, but there are a couple of points that can be quite tricky. It generally takes me around an hour and 45 minutes.

- Warp to *Farron Keep*.
- Kill the *Abyss Watchers* using the *Gold Pine Resin*.

### Catacombs of Carthus

- Head to the right and drop down.
- Kill the hat-wearing skeleton and pick up the *Undead Bone Shard* the ball of skeletons drops.
- Run to where the skeleton ball comes from and grab a *Large Titanite Shards*, then to the bonfire and light it. Don't rest if you don't have to.

- Warp to *Firelink Shrine*.
- Talk to *Greirat* again, tell him to go raiding.
- Sell all soul items, including boss souls, and any equipment you're not using. Also sell the *Twinkling Titanites*.

- Open the short cut down to the *Cleansing Chapel* and rest.

- Kill the mob, and then *Longfinger Kirk*, and then quickstep past the other giant.
- Open the final short cut, and kill *Patches*. This saves a lot of souls and quite a bit of trouble.
- Go over the bridge and light the *Rosaria's Bedchamber* bonfire. 
- Kill the *Deacons of the Deep*. Fight as normal in the first phase, in the second buff with a *Gold Pine Resin* then throw an *Alluring Skull* and kill the main dude when the others are distracted.
- Grab the *Archdeacon set*.
- Warp to *Cleansing Chapel* and rescue *Siegward* from the well.
- Warp to *Firelink Shrine*, sell all the stuff you can and level up *Endurance* to 12 then continue with the usual levelling strategy.

- Run to *Profaned Capital*, light the bonfire and grab the *Undead Bone Shard*.

- Buy a couple of *Human Pine Resins*.
- Level up as usual.
- Burn the *Undead Bone Shards*, upgrade the estus.

## Phase III: Getting tougher

This phase has some tougher bosses in. It's also where we switch to a luck based build for a better AR and bleed stats. It's fairly short and takes around 30 minutes.

- Warp to *Vordt of the Boreal Valley* bonfire.
- Kill the Dancer. Use a *Human Pine Resin* for extra damage.
- Run to the *Lothric Castle* bonfire, (*Alluring Skulls* help here - but you don't need to have one, you can lure the spear guy out and roll past him) and light it.

- Grab the *Robes of Prayer* to sell, and the *Titanite Chunk* here.

- Pick up the 3 *Titanite Chunks* in this area.
- Run to the *Dragon Barracks* bonfire.
- Warp back to Dragon Barracks, run over the bridge and drop down on the opposite side for the *Undead Bone Shard*. Drop down and kill the mob before they turn in to a Pus of Man. Run to the other end and do the same for the other one, and pick up two *Titanite Chunks*.
- Run back to the bonfire, past the thieves, and grab the soul item on the way.
- Drop down on the nearest side, grabbing the *Titantite Chunk* to the right, then head the other way.
- Run up the stairs, open the short cut and kill the dragon with firebombs. It takes 7 *Black Firebombs* and 1 or 2 *Firebombs*. It will drop 2 *Titanite Chunks*.
- Run out the back, grab another *Titanite Chunk* and kill a crystal lizard for two *Twinkling Titanites* that we can sell.

- Warp to *Firelink Shrine*, and upgrade the *Sellsword Twinblades* to +10.
- Reinforce estus and burn any bone shards you have.
- Warp to *Church of Yorshka*.

## Phase III: Final Push

This phase is a boss rush, with a bit of levelling up. We have all the items we need though so we don't need to worry about that.

- Kill Pontiff with parries and a *Gold Pine Resin*.
- Kill Aldrich with magic resistant gear, and a *Blue Bug Pellet*.
- Warp to Firelink Shrine and level up *Dexterity* if it's less than 40, otherwise level *Endurance*, then warp to *Dragon Barracks*.
- Kill Dragonslayer Armour using the Drang set, and a *Yellow Bug Pellet*.
- Head in to the archives, do as much damage as you can to the Crystal Sage.
- Take the short cut ladder up, finish off the Crystal Sage, run to the left, then drop down on to the bridge and keep going up.
- Jump to the right of where the first gargoyle is for a pretty big short cut. Be prepared to kill the two thralls that drop down along the side.
- Grab the *Undead Bone Shard* near the top of the archives.
- Run past the gank squad, go down the lift and rest at the bonfire to reset them before heading back up.
- Open the short cut, homeward bone to Firelink.
- Level up *Endurance* (*Dexterity* should already be 40).
- Buy at least 2 *Human Pine Resin*. If you have the souls for it buy 5 in total.
- Trigger the *Twin Princes* fight and homeward out.
- Stay near the fog wall, buff with *Human Pine Resin* and take out the *Twin Princes*.
- Warp to Firelink and level up *Endurance*.
- Kill Soul of Cinder with *Human Pine Resin*.

## THE END!
