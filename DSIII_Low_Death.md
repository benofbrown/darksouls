# Dark Souls III - Low Death run

This is my current strategy for finishing the game with as few deaths as possible, hopefully even 0 deaths soon.

## Character Creation

- Start as *Warrior*.
- Choose the *Life Ring*.

## Untended Graves

- Grab the soul item off to the right near the start.
- Grab the *Ashen estus flask*.
- Make the jump over by the tree and grab the *Titanite Shard*.
- Drop down, killing the crossbow guy and get the *Firebombs*.
- Kill all the mobs around there.
- Kill Iudex Gundyr.
- Unequip the *Ashen estus flask*, and all the items on your fast-menu whilst waiting for the door to open.

## Firelink Shrine

- Grab the *Homeward Bone* on the narrow path on the left, kill the mobs on the way.
- Kill all the mobs outside *Firelink Shrine*, but leave *Sword Master* well alone.
- Grab the other *Homeward Bone* and *Embers* around the outside of the shrine, and the *East-West Shield*.
- Go immediately to the right, up the stairs and outside, grabbing the soul item there. Don't do the tree skip yet, we'll do it later.
- Go back down inside the shrine, talk to *Andre* and allot all your estus to be healing.
- Go to the *Shrine Handmaiden* and sell all the soul items and the *East-West Shield*.
- Talk to the *Firekeeper* and level up *DEX* to 10 and *FAI* to 12.
- You should have at least 810 souls at this point, if not sell a *Homeward Bone* or an *Ember* then buy the following items:
    - 1 x *Prism Stone*
    - 1 x *Large Leather Shield*
- Embed the coil and warp to the *High Wall of Lothric*

## High Wall of Lothric

- Light the bonfire, and run down the stairs, taking the slightly raised path on the left. Grab the soul item there.
- Keep running, then go up the stairs on the left, loop around the dead dragon and drop down by a small tower. Grab the *Gold Pine Resin*.
- Drop down the hole, landing on the platform on the way down to avoid fall damage. Head out the door then run up the stairs past the mobs, and straight ahead through the door.
- Jump over to the other side, go through the door, stay on the raised path on the left and kill the mob there.
- Grab the soul item, then dodge the Lothric Knight and run up to, and then past, the *Tower on the Wall* bonfire.
- Grab the *Titanite Shard* there and go back to the bonfire, light it and rest at it if necessary.
- Go back downstairs, and drop down to the lower level. Head outside, and rush the mob who changes to a Pus of Man, killing them before they turn (takes two hits).
- Kill the *Crystal Lizard* for a *Raw Gem* and grab the soul item there. Also grab the *Firebombs* on the roof too.
- Drop down to the next level, and grab the *Black Firebombs*.
- Backtrack slightly in to the building you were on top of, and head to the left. Kill the crossbowman at the top of the stairs, then turn around and kill the lantern wielder behind you. Move in to the next room killing the bandit on the left and grab the *Titanite Shard*. Go back down the stairs, smash the pots and kill the mob behind them, and grab the *Undead Hunter Charm*.
- Dodge past the Lothric Knight with the spear, and head in to the corridor. Immediately roll to the right and smash through the barrels.
- _[Potential Danger]_ Run to the end of this platform, grab the *Green Blossoms*, and roll through yet more barrels. Drop down again, and grab then equip the *Astora Straight Sword*.
- Heal if necessary, then run and jump through the gap in the fence, rolling when you hit the ground and grab the *Estus Shard*. Keep rolling outside, then through the barrels and drop down. Run through the courtyard, and kill the crossbowman on the right, turn around and kill the other mob. Grab the soul item there and make your way to the Cathedral, talking to *Emma* and getting the *Small Lothric Banner*.
- Backtrack to where the crossbowman was, run straight ahead and take the lift up. Grab the *Throwing Knives* at the top, open the gate and run back to the *High wall of Lothric* bonfire. Kill any dogs that follow you up there, then warp to *Firelink Shrine*.

## Firelink Shrine II

- Run up and out, and do the Tree skip
- Drop the following for the crows:
    - 1 x *Firebomb*
    - 1 x *Black Firebomb*
    - 1 x *Prism Stone*
    - 1 x *Large Leather Shield*
- This will give you:
    - 1 x *Large Titanite Shard*
    - 1 x *Titanite Chunk*
    - 2 x *Twinkling Titanite*
- Grab the *Estus Shard*.
- Go through the illusory wall and get, then equip the *Silver Serpent Ring*
- Sell all your soul items to the *Shrine Handmaiden*.
- Make your way to *Andre*, infuse the sword with the *Raw Gem* and upgrade it to *Raw Astora Sword +1*. Also reinforce estus twice.
- Level up *VIG* with any remaining souls, there might not be enough at this time.
- Warp back to *High Wall of Lothric*.

## High Wall of Lothric II

- Use the shortcut and go and kill *Vordt of the Boreal Valley* using a *Gold Pine Resin* buff. Should be easy.
- Rest at the bonfire after killing him, then fly to the *Foot of the Wall*.

## Foot of the Wall / Undead Settlement

- Grab the soul item right near the start, to the left.
- Get the *Alluring Skulls*, *Homeward Bones* and talk to *Yoel of Londor* until he disappears.
- Get *Loretta's Bone*, then grab the *Estus Shard* behind the evangelist, run to the left and grab the *Titanite Shard*. Now run by the cliff edge and go over the bridge.
- Grab the soul item in the stables after killing the mobs. Kill the thief that drops down (should take three hits) and open the door.
- Bait the firebomb throwers in to blowing up the barrels, then drop down. Kill the mobs down there and grab the *Titanite Shard* before doubling back and lighting the *Cliff Underside* bonfire.
- _[Potential Danger]_ Go around towards the small bridge, and wait for the mobs to disperse. Run across it, and dodge the pot throwers. Keep running until you bump in to *Siegward of Catarina*.
- Send the lift down, then take it up and make friends with the giant, before going back down, then sending it up, and taking it down to the bottom.
- Run past the Outrider Knight, open the door and rest at the *Road of Sacrifices* bonfire.

## Road of Sacrifices

- Run through, killing the Corvians, and grabbing the *Titanite Shard*.

- Run down to the *Halfway Fortress* bonfire, chat to *Anri* and *Horace*.
- Carefully kill the mobs with the logs. Head round to the right at the bottom of the hill and kill the dog (a *Throwing Knife* is handy), and the mob there and grab the *Titanite Shard*.
- Backtrack slightly up the hill and drop down to find another *Titanite Shard*. Drop down again near here for yet another *Titanite Shard*.

## Farron Keep
- Go out and to the left slightly, don't sprint until near the swamp edge to minimise poison risk.

- Warp to *Tower on the High Wall*.

### Point of no return

Once we've got the *Dark Sigil* from *Yoel of Londor* we will gain one Hollowing with each death. As we now have a working death counter, this is the point at which we don't need to reset on death, although a death now would be disappointing.
