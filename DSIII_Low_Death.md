# Dark Souls III - Low Death run

This is my current strategy for finishing the game with as few deaths as possible. On the 22nd October 2016 I managed a run with 0 deaths.

The general strategy is to use a Raw weapon for most of the run, as it does decent damage and we can then concentrate on levelling up Vigour to give us a lot of HP. Later in the run the damage isn't as good, so we switch to a Luck/Bleed build using Anri's Straight Sword.

## Character Creation

- Start as *Warrior*.
- Choose the *Life Ring*.

## Phase I - Preparation

This phase takes around 45 minutes, and can be a little scary at times. If you die in this phase you need to reset the run which can be frustrating, particularly near the end. If you survive it though you'll have a +4 weapon and a lot of HP so the next few stages should be easy.

- Grab the soul item off to the right near the start.
- Grab the *Ashen estus flask*.
- Make the jump over by the tree and grab the *Titanite Shard*.
- Drop down, killing the crossbow guy and get the *Firebombs*.
- Kill all the mobs around there.
- Kill Iudex Gundyr. You can hit him five times as he wakes up. After that you want to parry/riposte him twice. If you hit him between parries he'll hit the second phase so you'll only be able to do one parry, so avoid hitting him until you get the second one in. Then stick close to his left leg and hit him a lot.
- Unequip the *Ashen estus flask*, and all the items on your fast-menu whilst waiting for the door to open.
- Kill all the mobs outside *Firelink Shrine*, but leave *Sword Master* well alone.
- Grab the other *Homeward Bone* and *Embers* around the outside of the shrine, and the *East-West Shield*.
- Go immediately to the right, up the stairs and outside, grabbing the soul item there. Don't do the tree skip yet, we'll do it later.
- Talk to the *Firekeeper* and level up *Dexterity* to 10 and *FAI* to 12.
- Go to the *Shrine Handmaiden* and sell all the soul items and the *East-West Shield*.
- You should have at least 810 souls at this point, if not sell a *Homeward Bone* or an *Ember* then buy the following items:
    - 1 x *Prism Stone*
    - 1 x *Large Leather Shield*
- Go back down inside the shrine, talk to *Andre* and allot all your estus to be healing.
- Embed the coil and warp to the *High Wall of Lothric*

### High Wall of Lothric

- Light the bonfire, and run down the stairs, taking the slightly raised path on the left. Grab the soul item there.
- Keep running, then go up the stairs on the left, loop around the dead dragon and drop down by a small tower. Grab the *Gold Pine Resin*.
- Drop down the hole, landing on the platform on the way down to avoid fall damage. Head out the door then run up the stairs past the mobs, and straight ahead through the door.
- Jump over to the other side, go through the door, stay on the raised path on the left and kill the mob there.
- Grab the soul item, then dodge the Lothric Knight and run up to, and then past, the *Tower on the Wall* bonfire.
- Grab the *Titanite Shard* there and go back to the bonfire, light it and rest at it if necessary.
- Go back downstairs, and drop down to the lower level. Head outside, and rush the mob who changes to a Pus of Man, killing them before they turn (takes two hits).
- Kill the *Crystal Lizard* for a *Raw Gem* and grab the soul item there.
- Drop down to the next level, and grab the *Black Firebombs*.
- Backtrack slightly in to the building you were on top of, and head to the left. Kill the crossbowman at the top of the stairs, then turn around and kill the lantern wielder behind you. Move in to the next room killing the bandit on the left and grab the *Titanite Shard*. Go back down the stairs, smash the pots and kill the mob behind them, and grab the *Undead Hunter Charm*.
- Dodge past the Lothric Knight with the spear, and head in to the corridor. Immediately roll to the right and smash through the barrels.
- Run to the end of this platform, grab the *Green Blossoms*, and roll through yet more barrels. Drop down again, and grab then equip the *Astora Straight Sword*.
- **[Potential Danger]** Heal if necessary, then run and jump through the gap in the fence, rolling when you hit the ground and grab the *Estus Shard*. Keep rolling outside, then through the barrels and drop down. Run through the courtyard, and kill the crossbowman on the right, turn around and kill the other mob. Grab the soul item there and make your way to the Cathedral, talking to *Emma* and getting the *Small Lothric Banner*.
- Backtrack to where the crossbowman was, run straight ahead and take the lift up. Open the gate and run back to the *High wall of Lothric* bonfire. Kill any dogs that follow you up there, then warp to *Firelink Shrine*.
- Run up and out, and do the Tree skip
- Drop the following for the crows:
    - 1 x *Firebomb*
    - 1 x *Black Firebomb*
    - 1 x *Prism Stone*
    - 1 x *Large Leather Shield*
- This will give you:
    - 1 x *Large Titanite Shard*
    - 1 x *Titanite Chunk*
    - 2 x *Twinkling Titanite*
- Grab the *Estus Shard*.
- Go through the illusory wall and get, then equip the *Silver Serpent Ring*
- Sell all your soul items to the *Shrine Handmaiden*.
- Make your way to *Andre*, infuse the sword with the *Raw Gem* and upgrade it to *Raw Astora Sword +1*. Also reinforce estus twice.
- Level up *Vigour* with any remaining souls, there might not be enough at this time.
- Warp back to *High Wall of Lothric*.
- Use the short cut and go and kill *Vordt of the Boreal Valley* using a *Gold Pine Resin* buff. Should be easy.
- Rest at the bonfire after killing him, then fly to the *Foot of the Wall*.

### Undead Settlement

- Grab the soul item right near the start, to the left.
- Get the *Alluring Skulls*, *Homeward Bones* and talk to *Yoel of Londor* until he disappears.
- Get *Loretta's Bone*, then grab the *Estus Shard* behind the evangelist, run to the left and grab the *Titanite Shard*. Now run by the cliff edge and go over the bridge.
- Grab the soul item in the stables after killing the mobs. Kill the thief that drops down (should take three hits) and open the door.
- Bait the firebomb throwers in to blowing up the barrels, then drop down. Rest at the *Cliff Underside* bonfire, then backtrack and kill the mobs down there before grabbing the *Titanite Shard* by the last one of them. By resting at the bonfire first you gain an advantage as the mobs aren't aggroed, and also don't have to wait as long for the mobs to disperse in the next step.
- **[Potential Danger]** Go around towards the small bridge, and wait for the mobs to disperse. Run across it, and dodge the pot throwers. Keep running until you bump in to *Siegward of Catarina*. **Make sure you talk to Siegward!**
- Send the lift down, then take it up and make friends with the giant, before going back down, then sending it up, and taking it down to the bottom.
- Run past the Outrider Knight, open the door and rest at the *Road of Sacrifices* bonfire.

### Road of Sacrifices

- Run through, killing the Corvians, and grabbing the *Titanite Shard* towards the end.
- Run down to the *Halfway Fortress* bonfire, chat to *Anri* and *Horace*.
- Kill the first two mobs with the tree stumps and drop down to the left to find another *Titanite Shard*. Drop down again near here for yet another *Titanite Shard*.
- Go around the left hand edge of the area, carefully killing the four mobs. Drop down for an *Estus Shard*.
- **[Potential Danger]** Kill the crucified mob and head to the *Crucifixion Woods* bonfire, grabbing the soul item on the way.
- **[Potential Danger]** Go to the edge of the water, drop down when it's low and run to the other side, grabbing the *Fallen Knight* set. Carefully run past the gank squad, down the ladder and light the *Farron Keep* bonfire.

### Farron Keep

- Go out and to the left slightly, don't sprint until near the swamp edge to minimise poison risk.
- Grab the *Estus Shard*, and just after it a *Titanite Shard*.
- Go up the hill carefully, there are two ghrus at the top. Kill them and extinguish the flame.
- **[Potential Danger]** Kill the jumping ghru. Grab the *Titanite Shard* near him, and the other *Titanite Shard* on the way up the hill.
- Kill the ghru at the top of the stairs, and grab the *Purple Moss Clump* before extinguishing the flame.
- Run to the *Keep Ruins* bonfire and rest.
- Drop down off the right of the ramp and roll under it for a *Titanite Shard*. Roll over to the domed building.
- Grab the *Undead Bone Shard* near the slugs, then go up the ladder. Go around the side of the building and kill the Crystal Lizard for a *Twinkling Titanite*. Go through the illusory wall to get the *Dreamchaser's Ashes*.
- Rest at the *Old Wolf of Farron* bonfire, then take the lift up, but don't fight the Stray Demon. Instead go the other way, drop down and go around the side, killing the two Crystal Lizards there for two *Large Titanite Shards*. Also get the *Dragoncrest Shield* and start using it.
- Homeward Bone to *Firelink Shrine*. I used to take the lift back down but the drop from the gate can kill you if you don't get it quite right so it's safter to warp out.
- Buy a *Dagger* and a *Torch*.
- Give the *Dreamchaser's Ashes* to the *Shrine Handmaiden* and sell her all your soul items.
- Go to *Andre* and upgrade your sword to *Raw Astora Sword +4*. Also use the three *Estus Shards* to reinforce your estus.
- Go to the *Firekeeper* and level up *Vigour* as much as you can.
- Go to *Yoel of Londor* and choose the *Draw Out True Strength* option, also levelling up *Vigour*.
- Burn the *Undead Bone Shard* that you have.

### Point of no return

Once we've got the *Dark Sigil* from *Yoel of Londor* we will gain one Hollowing with each death. As we now have a working death counter, this is the point at which we don't need to reset on death, although a death now would be disappointing.

## Phase II: Easy mode

This phase is pretty easy as you're quite OP by this point, but there are a couple of points that can be quite tricky. It generally takes me around an hour and 45 minutes. The Raw Astora Sword +4 does 229 AR, and you should have 24 Vigour by now. Along with 9 upgraded Estus flasks it shouldn't be too hard.

- Warp to *Tower on the High Wall*.
- Grab the *Firebombs* on the way down, and the ones by the Pus of Man on the roof (after killing the Pus of Man).
- Empty the room where we got our sword of mobs, and get the *Cell Key*.
- Use the key to rescue *Greirat* and warp back to *Cliff Underside*.

- Open the short cut gate, then kill the *Curse-rotted Greatwood*.
- Warp to *Crucifixion Woods*.

- Kill the *Crystal Sage*. No buffs required.
- Kill the two crystal lizards after that for two *Twinkling Titanites*.
- Run to the *Cathedral of the Deep* bonfire.

### Cathedral of the Deep

- Run towards the *Cleansing Chapel* bonfire, but don't open the doors yet.
- Kill the mobs by the cross and get the *Estus Shard*.
- Equip the *Torch* ready to use, and go around the side of the cathedral. Kill two crystal lizards for two *Twinkling Titanites*.
- Drop down through the window of the *Cleansing Chapel* and open the doors. If you have plenty of estus then don't enter yet, otherwise go in and rest.
- Run through the graveyard, dropping down to the right after a bit, then run past the slow mobs and take out the Grave Warden.
- Get the *Undead Bone Shard* and soul items.
- Equip the *Alluring Skulls* and use one near the small room that the thieves jump out of.
- Open the short cut down to the *Cleansing Chapel* and rest.
- Equip the *Dagger* in place of the *Torch*.
- Go back up, grab *Lloyd's Sword Ring* then drop down and kill the giant, collecting the *Large Titanite Shard* he drops, and the *Maiden* set.
- Kill the mob, and then *Longfinger Kirk*, and then quickstep past the other giant, picking up the *Drang Set* and a *Pale Tongue* on the way.
- Open the final short cut, and kill *Patches*. This saves a lot of souls and quite a bit of trouble.
- Go over the bridge and light the *Rosaria's Bedchamber* bonfire. Warp to *Cleansing Chapel* and rescue *Siegward* from the well.
- Warp back to *Rosaria's Chamber*.
- Kill the *Deacons of the Deep*. Fight as normal in the first phase, in the second buff with a *Gold Pine Resin* then throw an *Alluring Skull* and kill the main dude when the others are distracted.
- Grab the *Archdeacon set*.
- Warp to *Farron Keep*.
- Use the quickstep from the dagger to get past the basilisks and run up the ramp, killing the jumping ghru.
- Extinguish the last flame, cure your poison, kill *Yellowfinger Heysel* and homeward bone to *Firelink Shrine*.
- Talk to *Sirris of the Sunset Realm*.
- Talk to *Greirat* and give him *Loretta's Bone*.
- Sell the Deacons and Crystal Sages souls, and any other soul items.
- Give the handmaiden the *Mortician's Ashes*, *Paladin's Ashes*, and *Patches' Ashes*.
- Buy a *Gold Pine Resin*.
- Level *Vigour* if less than 40, else level *Endurance*
- Go to *Andre* and reinforce estus.
- Burn the two *Undead Bone Shards*.
- Warp to *Keep Ruins*, then run to *Farron Keep Perimeter* and light it.
- Kill the *Abyss Watchers* using the *Gold Pine Resin*.

- Warp to *Catacombs of Carthus*.
- Kill *High Lord Wolnir* with the *Shield of Want* equipped.

### Shield of Want

From now on you either want to have this shield equipped all the time, or switch to it quickly after a boss fight for maximum souls. You can't use it as a shield as you won't have enough *Strength*, but I don't really use it anyway. In times I do need a shield I either use the *Target Shield* for parrying or *Dragon Crest Shield* for blocking dogs etc.

### Irithyll of the Boreal Valley

- Kill Sulyvahn's Beast (carefully) and rest at the *Central Irithyll* bonfire.
- Backtrack to Sirris' summon sign on the bridge and help her kill *Creighton The Wanderer*.

- Run to *Profaned Capital*, light the bonfire and grab the *Undead Bone Shard*.
- Run to Yhorm, grab storm ruler and homeward out, unless you're comfortable with how much estus you have left, in that case kill Yhorm now.
- Kill Yhorm. Warp to Firelink.
- Buy a couple of *Human Pine Resins*.
- Level up as usual.
- Burn the *Undead Bone Shard*, upgrade the estus.
- Make sure you have ~20 Firebombs, and a *Gold Pine Resin*.
- **Talk to Anri!**

## Phase III: Getting tougher

This phase has some tougher bosses in. It's also where we switch to a luck based build for a better AR and bleed stats. It's fairly short and takes around 30 minutes.

- Warp to *Vordt of the Boreal Valley* bonfire.
- Start the Dancer fight, homeward out, then restart the fight. I just seem to handle it better that way. Use a *Human Pine Resin* for extra damage.

- Kill *Anri* with a *Gold Pine Resin*, and the crystal lizard outside for another *Twinkling Titanite*. Homeward to Firelink.
- Upgrade *Anri's Straight Sword* fully.
- Reinforce estus and burn any bone shards you have.
- Make sure you have at least two *Gold Pine Resin* and a *Blue Bug Pellet*.
- Warp to *Rosaria's Chamber*, join the covenant and reallocate stats to  *Vigour*: 40, *Dexterity*: 11, *Luck*: 30 and the rest in *Endurance*.
- Warp to *Demon Ruins* and kill *Old Demon King*.
- Warp to *Distant Manor*.

## Phase III: Final Push

This phase is a boss rush, with a bit of levelling up. We have all the items we need though so we don't need to worry about that.

- Open up the short cut to Pontiff. You'll need to kill *Londor Pale Shade* on the way, it's best not to aggro the dogs before this and fight them at the bottom of the stairs.
- Kill Pontiff with parries and a *Gold Pine Resin*.

- Run past the gank squad, go down the lift and rest at the bonfire to reset them before heading back up.
- Open the short cut, homeward bone to Firelink.
- Level up *Luck* to 40 then level *Endurance*.
- Trigger the *Twin Princes* fight and homeward out.
- Stay near the fog wall, buff with *Carthus Rouge* and take out the *Twin Princes*.
- Warp to Firelink and level up *Endurance* (*Luck* should already be at 40).
- Kill Soul of Cinder with *Carthus Rouge*.

## THE END!
