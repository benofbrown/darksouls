# NG++

Same as NG+, but no need for Red Jelly, and surrender to Gehrman. And grab the Hunter's Axe from the Messengers **Yharnam Sunrise**

# Chalice Dungeons

Easiest at the end, as you can buy Ritual Blood (5) in NG+ and beyond. Need to kill BSB in main game but you already do that for the trophy. Inspired by http://imgur.com/gallery/YobZp - I wanted a text based version to refer to and also take material availability in NG+ in to account.

## Materials from the main game

### For purchase:
- Coldblood Flowerbud: Don't worry about it, can buy it with insight from the messengers in NG+
- Pearl Slug: No biggy, you can pick up one per NG in Byrgenworth, or just buy them from the messengers.
- Ritual Blood (5): There's 3 in front of the gate you open in Upper Cathedral Ward. Grabbing them will save you a few echoes.
- Bastard of Loran: Buy these from the messengers, you need 2 (14 insight total).

### Missable:
- Red Jelly: You need four of these. Get 2 in each NG from Lecture Hall floor 1, on the right near the exit to Nightmare Frontier
- Living String: Kill the mother brain in Nightmare of Menis. Don't forget to do Make Contact at it first for the best Moon rune.

You should get enough echoes to buy the Ritual Blood (5) you need, as you shouldn't need to level by this point. You need 9 of them in total, and pick up three so need to spend 288000 echoes. Sounds like a lot but you will end up with a lot using the Moon runes.
