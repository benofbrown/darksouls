NG+
===

Unlike the first run this is the shortest cycle in the game, I'll just list boss order:

- Blazing Bull
- Ashina Elite
- **Genichiro**
- Armoured Warrior
- **Monkeys**
- Giraffe
- Snake Eyes
- Mist Noble
- **Corrupted Monk**
- **Guardian Ape**
- **Emma and Isshin**

Restart the next cycle in shame, as you are a monster!

NG++
====

The next cycle is the second slowest in the run, we go for the dragon ending so it takes longer.

Every time you warp after the Monkeys fight you need to remember to warp back to the Divine Child and get rice off them, then eat the rice.

We also want to buy Akos again so you need to make sure to follow that storyline

- Ogre
- **Gyobu**
- Blazing Bull
- Talk to the woman about the special child, then head to Senpu
- Grab the pinwheel
- Armoured Warrior
- Talk to the priest about the holy person, then warp to *Ashina Castle*
- Ashina Elite
- **Genichiro**
- **Monkeys**
- Get rice from the Divine Child and warp to *Lookout*
- Eavesdrop to find out the samurai need salt
- Giraffe
- Grab the *Dried Serpent* stuff
- Snake Eyes
- Mist Noble
- **Corrupted Monk**
- Warp to *Stairway*, talk to Anayama until he needs someone thick.
- Warp to divine child, get rice.
- Warp to start of Senpu, send Kotoro to Anayama.
- Puppet the little guy to put the kite up, run through the level to follow the kite.
- Drop in the water after killing the snake, and get the *Treasure Carp Scale*
- Warp to divine child, get rice.
- **Guardian Ape**
- Warp to the divine child, do as much as you can until she closes the doors
- Kill **Owl**
- Warp to the divine child, get the **Frozen Tears**
- Upgrade drop rate skill, go to Fountainhead, kill everyone as normal
- Buy the two *Lapis Lazuli* from the pot noble, and get a third from them by doing the Giant Carp stuff
- Before the dragon fight warp to *Stairway* and buy enough Akos so you have about 36 or so total
- Kill **Divine Dragon**
- Hit the idol then get the key off Emma, Run around for *Fulminated Mercury* and *Adamantite Scrap* and warp to the shrine

    - 36 Scrap Iron
    - 16 Scrap Magnetite
    - 12 Adamantite Scrap
    - 7 Black Gunpowder
    - 4 Yellow Gunpowder

    - Improved Sabimaru
    - Piercing Sabimaru
    - Long Spark
    - Sparking Axe
    - Purple Fume Spark
    - Lazulite Sabimaru
- Go and fight **Sword Saint Isshin**, give Kuro the **Frozen Tears** and start the next cycle

NG+3, NG+4
==========

Similar to NG+, these are just sprints through the game. Unlike NG+ we don't do Shura, we go through Fountainhead.


Here's the rough progress guide:

- Ogre
- **Gyobu**
- Blazing Bull
- Ashina Elite
- **Genichiro**
- Armoured Warrior
- **Monkeys**
- Giraffe
- Snake Eyes
- Mist Noble
- **Corrupted Monk**
- **Guardian Ape**
- **Owl**
- **True Monk**
- Okami Leader
- *NG+3 only:* buy the final two *Lapis Lazuli* we need, so no need for *Treasure Carp Scale* after that.
- **Divine Dragon**
- Run around grabbing *Fulminated Mercury* and *Adamantite Scrap*
- **Sword Saint Isshin**

Final Cycle (NG+5)
==================

We do *most* of this cycle but not all of it. It's the same as NG+4 above, but without *Sword Saint Isshin*

After *Divine Dragon* we go to the *Stairway* idol and farm for the final skills we need. It generally takes around 20 minutes. Using the *Sparking Axe* on the cannon guys speeds it up.

Remaining Prosphetic tools
==========================

To get the remaining tools we need the following:

- 37 Scrap Iron
- 25 Scrap Magnetite
- 16 Adamantite Scrap
- 10 Black Gunpowder
- 15 Yellow Gunpowder
- 11 Fulminated Mercury
- 25 Lump of Fat Wax
- 15 Lump of Grave Wax
- 8 Lapis Lazuli
- 19600 Sen

If you're lucky with drop rates you can get this done before the final game cycle.
