Sekiro All Trophies
===================

Rough route notes for a run to get all the trophies in Sekiro.

This isn't the fastest route, but an attempt to reduce farming.

First run
---------

This is the longest of the game cycles, as we need to fight all the bosses and get all the beads.

- Run through the Prologue, grabbing the **Fistful of Ash** just after the optional miniboss, who we don't fight.
- Die to Genichiro. There's no point trying in this fight. Be ready to hit dodge though to get back up quickly when hit to speed it up.
- Grab the **Light Coin Purse** behind the temple and the **Pellet** in front of it.
- Go through the first area, killing the two mobs at the start and grabbing the **Ako's Sugar** below the second one.
- Jump down to grab the **Fistful of Ash**  then grapple up and go in to the bridge to get the **Shuriken Wheel**.
- Grab the **Pellet** then fight the first general for the first **Gourd Seed** (1/10) and **Prayer Bead** (1/40). Make the fight easier by looping behind for the backstab, and make sure you loot them after killing them.
- Drop down to the left after the area you fought the general and backstab the guy with the rifle. Double back and climb up the wall before grappling on to the roof and grabbing the **Light Coin Purse**. Drop down and kill the other rifleman, then drop down behind the three patrolling guys, backstab one and kill the others. Grapple up the towers then jumping deathblow the guy with the hat, and kill the guy with him. Drop down the back and kill the big guy, and then the last guy in this little section.
- Grab the three **Light Coin Purses** and grab the **Young Lord's Bell Charm** from the old woman.
- Grapple up then jump over to grab the three **Gachiin's Sugar**, then grapple up and loop around behind the cannon woman for a backstab.
